# NAME

nagval - Nagios/Icinga plugin to check validity of one or more DNSSEC domains

# SYNOPSIS

nagval [-f _file_] [_domain_ _rr_]

# DESCRIPTION

*nagval* (i.e.  "Nagios Validator") is a Nagios/Icinga plugin to check the validity 
of a DNSSEC-signed zone over the DNS.

Typical use of *nagval* as a Nagios plugin is to specify a single _domain_ and _resource record type_. Optionally, a list of domains can be provided in a file.

# MOTIVATION

Why another DNSSEC validator? There are lots of those around already!
Yes, there are (see below). Most of them retrieve an RRSIG and perform date
arithmetic on the expiration times. Based on an idea I read in a paper
by Stephane Bortzmeyer, I decided to have a validating resolving DNS
server do the brunt of the validation work -- after all, that's what it's
supposed to be good at, right?

That is what *nagval* does. It uses the _dnsval_ library from the DNSSEC-Tools
project to send a query to a validating resolver, evaluating the results returned
in the answer. For example, If I check a domain using a BIND validating resolver

	$ nagval jpmens.org SOA
	jpmens.org/SOA: SUCCESS

I see the following in BIND's log

	query: jpmens.org IN SOA +EDC (127.0.0.1)
	query: jpmens.org IN DNSKEY +EDC (127.0.0.1)
	query: jpmens.org IN DS +EDC (127.0.0.1)
	query: org IN DNSKEY +EDC (127.0.0.1)
	query: org IN DS +EDC (127.0.0.1)
	query: . IN DNSKEY +EDC (127.0.0.1)

Note how *nagval* issued queries with EDNS0 DNSSEC OK (DO) and Checking Disabled (CD).

# OPTIONS

*nagval* understands the following options. 

-f *file*
:   Specify a file containing a list of domains to check. The file must contain
    a list of domains, one per line, where each domain is optionally followed by
    a slash (/) and a DNS resource record type to check. The type defaults to
    *SOA* if it is not specified.
-v
:   Verbose. Use with _-f_ for verbose output.

Example:

	$ cat domains
	google.com/A
	orange.kame.net/AAAA
	ip.jpmens.org/a
	infoblox.com/NS
	jasadvisors.com/DNSKEY
	verisignlabs.com
	chainzombies.com/A
	sanibar.com
	ibadancer.com
	wnagele.com/A
	b.aa/soa

	$ nagval -v -f domains
	google.com/A: PINSECURE
	orange.kame.net/AAAA: PINSECURE
	ip.jpmens.org/A: SUCCESS
	infoblox.com/NS: SUCCESS
	jasadvisors.com/DNSKEY: SUCCESS
	verisignlabs.com/SOA: SUCCESS
	chainzombies.com/A: SUCCESS
	sanibar.com/SOA: SUCCESS
	ibadancer.com/SOA: SUCCESS
	wnagele.com/A: SUCCESS
	b.aa/SOA: UNTRUSTED_ANSWER
	11 domains checked: 8 valid, 3 warnings

# BUGS

Yes.

# RETURN CODES

*nagval* exits with a code 0, 1, or 2 indicating a status of OK, WARNING, or
CRITICAL. Currently, if a domain does not validate a status CRITICAL is issued,
else OK.
